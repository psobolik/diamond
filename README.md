# Diamond
## a.k.a. Fun with assembly

* Writes a diamond pattern of asterisks to stdout.
* Diamond size (number of rows and columns) may be specified on command line; default size is 21.
* Diamond size must be an odd number, and a command line value will be modified if necssary.
* Completely pointless, except as an exercise in x64 assembly.
